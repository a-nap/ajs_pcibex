# Acceptability Judgment Task for PCIbex

This is an experiment template which allows the experimenter to collect 
naturalness ratings to sentence stimuli. The experiment consists of the 
following parts:

1. Obligatory ethics agreement
2. Form for inputting general demographic participant information (ID, native
languages, federal state, age, gender, handedness)
3. Instructions
4. Exercise
5. Continue to experiment display
6. Main experiment sequence
7. End screen and experiment explanation

The experiment is in German but the comments and the majority of the code is in 
English.

## Task description

The participants are asked to read short sentences and rate their acceptability 
on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (very unnatural) to 7 (very natural). The 
sentence and the scale are presented simultaneously. In the main experiment 
procedure, the stimuli presentation is randomly shuffled between critical items
and distractor sentences.

Once the participants consent to the ethics agreement, the list (or group) 
counter switches to the next list/group. This is because in my experiments, 
multiple participants can start the experiment simultaneously. By default, PCIbex
switches to the next list once the participant has finished the experiment.

At the end of the experiment, a random code is generated that the 
participants should email to the principal researcher in order to receive 
compensation.
